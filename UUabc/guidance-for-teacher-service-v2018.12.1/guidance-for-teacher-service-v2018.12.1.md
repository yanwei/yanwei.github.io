# Guidance for Teacher Center 2.0 (v2018.12.1)

<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://yanwei.github.io/auto-number-title.css" />

<p align='right'>v0.1, Last Update: 2018.12.15</p>

## Overview of the whole system: platform 1.0 and 2.0

### System overview

UUabc has released the version 2.0 platform in December 2018 which involves a new scheduling system, mobile phone App for the teachers, and self-registration & referral system for candidate teachers.

However, since we still have thousands of students attending the classical one-on-one and one-on-four classes, the version 1.0 platform will still be used for the next couple of months before the students are completely migrated to platform 2.0.

As a result, UUabc's students, teachers, and some of the support team will be divided into two sections.

The following diagram illustrates the differences and relationship between the old and new platforms:
